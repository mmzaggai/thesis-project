it might be convicted by the icj anyway sure and it would be guilty of committing genocide if it does this remember the idea came from donald trump so who is going to impose this welp pro palestinians should work to capture the us presidency and finally shut off funding to israel capitalize on the historic unpopularity israel has had in america across the political spectrum

important sidenote the british mandate of palestine could have halted the influx of international jews which ultimately led to the arabic revolt the british didn t support the creation of a jewish state but confusingly d d promise a secure homeland and then had no choice but to back the creation of the state of israel because they pretty much almost facilitated the start of another jewish massacre but where did that leave the arabs nowhere it is too easy to say that the palestinians should have accepted ss while they didn t even cause the holocaust they were kept to a moral duty to protect the jews while they themselves also wanted full autonomy of their country the british could also have not promised the jews a homeland and just let the palestinians rule under british mandate truth be told it is not strange and actually completely understandable that the natives then protested against a huge influx of jewish migrants there s a good reason why countries are so against refugees asylumseekers etc right now and europe and the us would rather have people die at sea or at the borders then take care of those who wish nothing but to live a safe life and build their future jews should acknowledge this part too it s wrong to completely dismiss this part i truly feel for the jews who ve literally looked pure evil in the eyes and to this day do not seem to be able to live their lives without being in a constant state of fear but i also absolutely feel for the palestinians because if anything the jews rightfully so at least had some protection and could live relatively normal in israel while the palestinians were maltreated thrown in jail for no reason have been living in refugee camps for decades have to pass check in points to get to their homes if those homes are not stolen by kolonists etc or destroyed by israeli bombing they became what you used to be and that is not to be ignored

and why wasnt your town ethnically cleansed if the jews are such arab haters yet every jew was kicked out of every arab country the one jewish state has mosques that are full every friday night but the synagogues of the arab world are a pile of rubble if they havent been converted to mosques and you sit there chastising the one group in the middle east that isnt commiting ethnic cleansing and has actual minority rights you should have israeli flags and soldier posters all over your walls but id accept simple gratitude for your life not being total shit in one of the surrounding insane asylums ill get neither

any reputable sources with less bias non jewish source seems to state that there are definitely massacres of families but does not explicitly beheadings of babies beheadings of people yes but no babies weird wonder if biased media is just trying to make them look even worse than they already look for doing what they ve done they re terrible already but accuracy in reporting is important

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2023-12-05 19:06:31+00:00 --- ---
that doesn t explain it because the amount of child fatalities would go up less than the total fatalities added that date

yes the israeli rapist he was invited on to israeli national tv where they had a face reveal ceremony to cheers by the audience and he was treated as a national hero maybe he was invited to c a far right cesspool media was he on of the accused or one of the innocent from the us gov state department rape and domestic violence rape is illegal under pa law but the legal definition does not address spousal rape punishment for conviction of rape is five to years in prison the pa repealed a law that relieved a rapist of criminal responsibility if he married his victim neither the pa nor hamas effectively enforced laws pertaining to rape in the west bank and gaza so yes rape is illegal in the palestinian territories and your link is wrong okay but that wasn t what the report claimed now was it it claims there is no law for rape against married women which is what your link claims and that there is no legal prosecution against forced prostitution which the us already stated with respect to sex trafficking commensurate with those prescribed for other grave crimes such as rape inconsistent with the definition of trafficking under international law the law did not establish the use of force fraud or coercion as an essential element of the crime because the law doesn t establish forced prostitution as a crime most pimps and customers are held with prostitution penalties which are patheticly small a month while the victim also held with the same law leading that rape victims are actually punished for being raped but why are you even using palestine as a defence and comparison to israel there is a vast difference in socio economics between both and don t you claim to be the only liberal democracy in the middle east you are generalizing a population based on remarks of one person well based on the actions of a government according to you palestinians are rapists maniacs

the previous reference openly acknowledged the other reason that the bds call is so important is that it reminds the palestinians of the goals for which they struggle self determination and the three goals of freedom from occupation equality for palestinian citizens of israel and right of return for the refugees the claim for right of return for descendants has as the openly admitted goal by arab leaders over the decades ending the jewish state by demography beinart is openly anti zionist and calls for the dismantling of the jewish state again find me a single quote from any of these bds leaders endorsing peace between a future arab palestine and the jewish state of israel just one

first of all it s not times worse currently it s about times worse but let s assume that was hyperbole it s definitely worse regardless what i find interesting is that hardly anyone seems to connect the dots between gaza firing thousands of rockets which are known to have a failure rate with the amount of child fatalities seen in the early days of this conflict when hamas began running out of rockets the rate at which children and women were dying dropped significantly the more idf advanced into gaza the number of deaths for men went up while the number of deaths for women and children went down and the overall rate of death has also gone down we re not seeing the rapid death tolls that we saw from october december

do palestinian citizens of israel think they live under apartheid yes in a margin excel survey data linked a regime in which one group controls and perpetuates its control over another through laws practices and coercive forced means is considered an apartheid regime in your opinion does this description fit or it doesn t fit israel very much fit somewhat fits doesn t really fit not at all also from the same survey of palestinian citizens of israel feel that they would not be treated fairly by the israeli supreme court vs of jewish israelis

my jaw on the floor reading this comment dude you do not know anything about the middle east lebanon is mostly muslim israel has treaties w jordan and egypt they fought as allies with the lebanese what harm have they done them israel also has allies within rebel groups in syria they are enemies of hezbollah and assad bc they are part of the iranian axis jews were ethnically cleansed from countries like iraq yemen and morocco has nothing to do with israel palestinians support muslim brotherhood ideology they are devote islamists they do not accept gays and women rights they believe in killing israelis to get to heaven you are so naive it s painful and the idea that bc they ve been through a lot means they will be gentle peace living hippies is naive about human nature in general it s quite literally always the opposite

you called them apartheid states and compared their behavior to israel you re literally making the argument that israel is an apartheid state what i understand you re saying is that unless all of them are fixed don t worry about israel or that israel is being held to a higher standard and to that i would ask where should we start israel is just the most prominent example of this if your issue is that people don t care for these other apartheid states genocides you re right and i think there is legitimate criticism for those people who keep saying they want to be more educated but simply stop at the information thats spoon fed to them by the media they re all wrong

israel did break the ceasefire within days that s an abject fact obviously all civilians caught up in this mass is a tragedy i never said it wasn t my statement was saying that since almost tons of bombs have been dropped on a mile long strip that s basically the equivalent of two nuclear blast that it might be hard for hamas to keep track of bodies and keep straight whos who again i never said it wasn t sad just stating objective facts

hamas is not in control of anything above ground in gaza the un was in control of food distribution until israel kicked them out and held back aid for months since then israel has only allowed the ghf to control aid which has been a disaster the only question is to what extent this disaster has been intentional on their part it s clear that there are disagreements in israel s war cabinet about whether palestinians should be allowed to eat or not

ating again and again that israel is committing genocide it s actually disgraceful it s an insult to the many genocides that have actually occurred in the last years that no one cares about or even knows of let me explain why the genocide claims are n the genocide accusation has done a good job ostracizing actual israelis from the peace movement many want their loved ones back or for hamas to be stopped but could be easily convinced the carpet bombing has been excessive and maybe even criminal these people by and large hate their current government it wouldn t be much to convince them there unhinged ring wing party is using the conflict as cover for massive escalation and collective punishment instead people chant stuff like river to the sea and accuse israelis of genocide and ethnic cleansing america can t stop this war like some believe but israelis can it is so important to reach them but there emotional and irrational right now there vulnerable to rationalization and propaganda peace movements had to be better about this i just fear too many anti semites grabbed the reign s on a lot of these protests instead of a focus on war it became a tirade against israel sure israel has done its fair share of sht but we should be focused on the immediate situation at hand we need to show love and compassion to all sufferers and not antagonize any group
