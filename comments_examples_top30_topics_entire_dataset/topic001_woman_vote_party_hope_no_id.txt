we cannot know what israel showed her it might be something unrelated to oct but the clearing of the palestinians and their houses from gaza edit consider how much she had seen before joining the group trying to send aid into gaza

i don t see there s any other way to view it she was kicked off the team because of her ethnicity and or religion do you think she would have been kicked off the team if she had supported signing cuad or rather not objected if you think not then she was kicked off not for her religion or ethnicity but for her politics it is true that there can be a strong relationship between religion culture and political beliefs for example most evangelical christians oppose gay marriage equality but discrimination based on political belief is not the same as discrimination based on identity we know that jews in america have a wide range of beliefs regarding israel so if the basis of discrimination is not her jewish identity but rather her political beliefs then it is not antisemitism unless of course you consider all anti zionism to be antisemitic

it s antisemitism pure and simple it s pressure from qatar on all these organizations like glastonbury and the toronto film festival to make people bow to their wish to delegitimize israel and jews gadot is not responsible for the israeli government she has no say in what they do but if she can t go because of that connection no muslims by virtue of their religion should be allowed to attend because of their complicity in the starvation in sudan yemen and the massacres occurring in syria darfur and the congo the hypocrisy and discrimination are staggering i hope she sues them and wins

she celebrates jewish christmas and has mentioned that she is jewish in about of her lifetime comments and that her kids are not raised jewish yes i checked because i don t believe the as a jews on here it s gotta be some kind of complex she has i d ignore her if she wants to lay with those who want her deleted and for jews to live in diaspora and to believe israel was created in a vacuum so be it

i ve heard the oct footage they wanted to show to her isn t available to the public why is that might it not hold up to scrutiny it matches well with the blocking of independent journalists from having access to gaza to do their job one can t simultaneously block international journalists and call everything else that s not their info to be propaganda and have any shred of credibility

the fact that francesca albanese is a un official having anything to do with israel is a reflection on the un just as the fact that amnesty and hrw hire staffers with previous experience in anti israel movements reflects their predetermined outcomes then as now she refers to israel as a settler colonial enterprise and to jews in israel and the pre state british mandate as foreign interlopers subjugating an indigenous palestinian population in her first official report to the un this year she urged a rejection of the conflict paradigm describing israel solely as an oppressor and legitimizing palestinian resistance she rarely acknowledges palestinian terrorism america and europe one of them subjugated by the jewish lobby and the other by the sense of guilt about the holocaust remain on the sidelines and continue to condemn the oppressed the palestinians who defend themselves with the only means they have deranged missiles instead of making israel face its international law responsibilities albanese wrote the israeli lobby is clearly inside your veins and system and you will be remembered to have been on the big brother s side of this orwellian sic nightmare caused once again by israel s greed shame on you bbc she wrote in a post uncovered by the times of israel she shared a picture of what she said was a nazi trooper and a jewish man and next to it an israeli soldier and a palestinian and in an interview with italian media she compared the nakba the palestinian word for the catastrophe of israel s creation to the holocaust in a comment that was previously reported by the pro israel group un watch

yup they picked up some sort of boneless stuffed toy crafting in gaza is kinda weird personally i think embroidery is more enjoyable but to each his own i guess how did her body get burnt to a crisp and get robbed of all its bones as well as change size while everything around her was on the exact same condition why was there a camera perfectly centered and poised and focused on this body at the exact same time as this attack good thing there were paramedics there within three seconds maybe if there was a real bomb they would have warned her instead
