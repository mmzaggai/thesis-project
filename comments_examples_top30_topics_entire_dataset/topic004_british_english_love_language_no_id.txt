jewish people define themselves differently and always have they are an ethnoreligion you cannot compare them to the irish because the irish are not an ethnoreligion telling jewish people that the way they chose to define themselves is antisemitic is peak irony frankly

i guess i m saying that when the foreign occupier has tanks on your streets its police have been brutalising your people and massacring them while attending funerals or protesting there is legitimacy in taking up arms in retaliation paddy s ancestors knew that and i think he knows that

wah wah kneecap are awful for criticising genocide but not a word for israel who ve dropped more than tonnes of bombs on square kilometers of mostly women children cop on to yourself the so called antisemitism in ireland that s being pushed by british israeli and yank commentators has overwhelmingly been criticism of genocide and apartheid our chip on the shoulder is a recognition that yes colonialism is bad and that yes we unfortunately have experienced our fare share so we might just know what we re on about the troubles only ended in the s yet no irish person alive experienced british state persecution give it up already sick of your lot painting us with the ism of the week when most of us couldn t care less about religion we just don t want to watch the indiscriminate murder of children i can understand why a unionist might struggle to understand this

this is a little like telling indians or irish there wasn t an irish state before the english nation states are a fairly recent invention arguably by the british or sometimes thought of as france following the french revolution palestine was under the control of other power from before the first nation state existed until the british began their withdrawal so i m not quite sure why you would make this argument

i m irish and i agree with you i d like to add that most irish project onto the palestinians and hamas what motivations they want them to have pro pal irish people like to view hamas like william wallace or michael collins but they miss the key points i always encourage people to take them at their word listen to what they re saying listen to the speech s read the charter look at the polls give the palestinians the respect they deserve listen to them they re not motivated by freedom or having a state they re motivated by destroying the jewish one

gaza isn t occupied ireland was but i m still human enough to fully condemn the ira s actions methods and absolutely believe they should have been killed if caught intentionally slaughtering innocent people is never ok not quite sure why this is a controversial take israel does what it can to limit innocent deaths in my opinion of course which is far different than hamas

i am irish my ancestors did not commit any form of colonialism furthermore we had a brutal colonial regime ruling us for years the scars of it is still seen today in northern ireland with massive chucks of the area having been completely depopulated of its native population to make room for the settlers just like what happened and still is happening in palestine ashkenazi jews are so far removed from their distant levantine ancestors that no they are not as indigenous as palestinians and definitely not more so also you are not an immigrant if you take over the country you immigrate to you are a colonialist

same way boston became an irish city a wave of immigrants move their the original owners mostly english ethnically benefit financially from having access to a cheaper workforce they thus welcome the immigration even though it involves some displacement an irish culture develops in sections of the city but the english are tolerant of this as the city becomes increasingly irish they move out to the suburbs with a lot of wealth created from both the higher return on investment and higher sales prices the influx of irish created the city ends up quite mixed but the main distribution is an irish core and english suburbs as dominant no violence no hate no killing nothing remotely like what happened in palestine

that s funny because that s quite literally the typical american response american history books omit ireland s oppression and their own separate experiences with the barbary slave trade that coincided with america s investment in the transatlantic slave trade concurrently to this day that information is suppressed and denied by racist extremists typically afropessimists that refuse to believe anyone from europe has ever experienced slavery especially at the hands of a north african slave owner so yes you often find the small group of racist minorities in america will literally invalidate the entire irish experience as an oppressed people americans are so stupid that they don t even know we re indigenous irish is also an indigenous language spoke in ireland and it s ancient like us we were colonized by england before america was and to this day the north of ireland remains colonized and then on top of being white indigenous and colonized irish folk were repetitively kidnapped by barbary pirates and sold as slaves when it wasn t their slavery to the pirates they were indentured servants or the live in help nannies maids as time progressed and they remained poor as an immigrant class in an america that stereotyped and ridiculed them as inferior the racism was so terrible that an entire deployment of irish troops went awol from the army frontlines during the mexican american war and they ran across the border to immigrate to mexico they were called the san patricios we have every reason to side with palestine but some of the extremist racist american minorities perpetuate the notion that all white people are oppressors or colonizers automatically invalidating our entire history of relatable subjugation and second class citizenship in both europe and america indigenous white people exist like the basque the sapm and the chachapoya cultures in america to be indigenous is to be immediately assumed to be dark skinned and they look down on you and resent you for having pale skin even though we re both indigenous palestinians are the same way they come in beautiful dark skin tones or sometimes very european features and incredibly pale skin tones i ve seen palestinian with blue eyes and blonde hair even their characteristics are very subtle so they could easily be mistaken for spaniard or italian or white so the question is do people only care about palestinians if they look tan or does this activism include pale palestinians too do people only care about the palestinians as long as they have the same skin tone or hair texture or do they care for every single palestinian pale or tan this comment section reeks of subtle colorism and i feel for the palestinians that these people think they re supporting

would also add in the case of ireland only a small minority of irish actually supported the ira there s a famous song from an irish rock band during the time you might ve heard called zombie it talks about old prejudices blinding people and was written in remembrance when one of the singers witnessed the warrington bombings that resulted in the death of two children she among many other irish were strongly against the ira and she hated how they claimed to represent the irish with palestine it s a bit different a majority to overwhelming majority of palestinians according to polls done by palestinian organizations there support or strongly support hamas military wing yes military wing al qassam and when their support drops for the organization it s likely due to hamas not delivering on its promises to push the needle for palestinian statehood and just to be clear it doesn t mean palestinians are inherently bad or somehow all guilty it just means we need to pause before we make what seem like simple comparisons and realize they re quite different only then can we make steps towards solving the israel palestine conflict

i m not arguing anything of the sort about the economic impact of the mandate in fact it did make things better economically that s why many arabs moved from other arab regions in the levant i m well aware however that the arabs were not placated by this they did not ask for jews to immigrate and they weren t impressed by progress and economic development fair enough the second part about the irish totally agree there is nothing similar between the situations except who was a revolutionary and actually drove out the british that s why i m extremely puzzled why the irish in particular want to jump into this fray because they ve decided arabs good revolutionaries like us and jews british overlord oppressors and unlike the indians or serbs solidarity with one side or another isn t just based on the enemy of my enemy is my friend logic i don t know what dog irish catholics have in this fight unless it s entirely based on the balfour declaration and wwi era british actions which it could be
