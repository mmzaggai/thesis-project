starbucks doesn t give money to israel that being said they still have a habit of being anti worker and anti union and that s reason enough to continue boycotting them

i d be interested in seeing this information as well i don t think this boycott is having any influence on the israeli government s decisions in light of bibi s spiritual connection speech i saw today where norways pif divested in israeli assets but the article was vague on the companies that were involved from my limited research the list of companies that are being targeted are large multinational corporations that are not necessarily based in israel but have been perceived to be complicit in human rights violations illegal settlements or the occupation of palestinian territories this includes caterpillar hewlett packard vella orange crh netafim all of the tech giants if you happen to stumble across more information please share

starbucks gaza is ruining our image the palestine supporters yes

there s a couple of things at play starbucks is a gross union buster and when their union tweeted in support of palestine starbucks sued them technically starbucks does not directly support israel they even went through the effort of publishing that on their website i don t know if it s still there but what it does not acknowledge is that howard schultz the biggest shareholder funds so many zionist projects is a vocal supporter of israel has won awards from israeli orgs for his contributions etc i find that type of obfuscation incredibly insidious i also thing it was right time right place starbucks should have been cancelled a long time ago their coffee sucks and is expensive it was an easy target at a time when people needed to cut discretionary spending love to see that they re actually acknowledging gaza as the reason

anti union anti customer crappy coffee farmer abuse predatory anti environment racist anti homeless plenty of reasons to boycott starbucks which i ve done for years gaza and is is not one of them the only connection whatsoever to is is howard schultz s investments in wiz yes he owns of starbucks outstanding shares if this is an is connection for you then that s your call he neither runs the company nor currently sits on the board peet s coffee on the other hand is privately owned by the reimann family formerly nazi collaborators one of the reimann s companies supported bds and the family made it clear that was unacceptable to them so peet s is clearly a company i won t patronize

yeah okay i give you that emirates etihad saudia are consumer facing but i am not all that sure that there is a particularly large overlap between passengers of these airlines and anti israel protesters either zim meanwhile is hard to boycott for consumers anyway the average guy no matter their stance on either gaza or the sudanese civil war seldom purchases container capacity on the spot market mcdonalds corporate in the us does not have any influence over whether a random franchisees decides to give free food to service members in a foreign country a protestors may not know that b technically they could by amending the franchisee agreements and threatening termination non renewal thereof

the people who actually have to deal with the repercussions of decisions tend to be far more realistic about their choices privileged naive coffee shop marxists can afford to be idealistic because they aren t the ones who will have to worry about being dragged from their houses by hamas terrorists

the only influence of the list of boycotted companies that i can see is it gives the college radical muslim organizations like sjp and their fellow travelers like jvp a tenuous hook to demand their university divest from these companies or more usually divest from funds which might invest in those companies hey can t use index funds because catepilliar is on a the s p gotcha boom we gotta divest and occupy the campus and shut it down until divestment a complete wild goose chase but effective didn t stop the invasion of rafah or saving your boy sinwar but you did get a ton of great pallywood p s netafin what hewlett packard boycott might not be because of israel people are already mad at hewlett packard about those crappy super pricey ink cartridges where the printer won t run with budget ink many people in the west are angrier with hewlett packard about this than angry with jews ymmv

why ban exporting coal to the jews looks like the ban is to israel jewish people aren t banned by ethnicity from buying things the general idea of boycotting a country is to pressure them into changing their political decisions and conduct also that s the country of colombia the op is about the american columbia university

or outside of starbucks we have plenty of incredible independent coffee roasters here starbucks coffee is awful not to mention they use to be several on the same street so they could snuff out any competition not sure why anyone went there even before the boycott

you are incorrect edit starbucks gives no money to support israel or it s causes as a publicly traded company any donations would be officially reported and there are none edit as a publicly held company that press release j linked was written by someone then reviewed by an army of corporate lawyers and then was only published after executive approval

some business will fall through the cracks obviously the more prevalent a brand and their products are in everyday life the more exposed they are to potential consumer pressures lots of companies even some of the larger billion dollar companies that are huge supporters of one political agenda or another can still go completely unnoticed by the public because of how they ve chosen to structure their business there s no standard in recognizing which companies get shunned it s really just a fee for all so all you can do as a company is not make yourself a target or do the exact opposite and embrace the criticism it really just depends on the strategy and i m not saying that just because a company takes a public stance on some issue it means that they are actually endorsing it it just means that s what they want it to look like the board of a company can be full of closet racists but still portray themselves as totally inclusive
