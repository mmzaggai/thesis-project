no i am arguing the only difference between a prisoner taken without trial and a hostage is that a hostage is used for leverage and therefore they re morally equivalent

hostage rescue missions in territory controlled by the enemy are a coin toss at best true

really not the people who took somewhere around hostages and now only or less of them are left not the people who murdered people in cold blood during a music festival if you re talking about right now i guess you re technically right they probably murdered the bibas family a month or so ago unfortunately

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-08-27 13:48:50+00:00 --- ---

if they don t know where the hostages are why do they keep bombing random houses

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-04-27 17:45:06+00:00 --- ---

you seem to be under the belief that there are hostages alive to release i doubt that s the case

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-06-08 15:15:22+00:00 --- ---

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-08-15 23:52:21+00:00 --- ---
who started this war who took hostages who raped civilians who uses civilian infrastructure as bases

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-03-03 08:31:23+00:00 --- ---
the key word here is hostages

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2023-10-31 01:30:43+00:00 --- ---
you ve already written off the lives of the hostages i ve got an idea how about if you be the one to tell the families that they will just have to accept that their loved ones are dead even though they are still alive

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-09-02 00:13:08+00:00 --- ---
that s just means you think it s an accurate metaphor still a metaphor i don t think these kids actually qualify as hostages under the geneva convention the rome statute or the hostage convention

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-12-27 08:08:17+00:00 --- ---
you mean bombing is to free the hostages are you going to bomb them when they come with hostages

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-06-09 04:53:56+00:00 --- ---
civilians kept hostages inside their homes they knew about it and took part in it whether it was willingly or not doesn t change the fact they were used as human shields and that these tactics are wrong

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2023-11-20 12:47:02+00:00 --- ---
what does the international law and rome whatever say about abducting babies as hostages what does the x y z say about refusing to allow red cross visits to the abductees ditto what does the x y z say about refusing to even provide a list of hostages and specify if alive or dead the international law says apparently nothing

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-08-09 15:33:42+00:00 --- ---
the goal was never to return the hostages regardless of how many times it was said if it was they would have held negotiations until they were all freed

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-06-08 12:04:47+00:00 --- ---
the people who held the hostages were civilians they just lived their civilian lives with just one more task of keeping the hostages and making sure they don t run away

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-06-09 02:09:39+00:00 --- ---
i m happy the hostages were rescued too man but i stumbled on some videos of blown up children and exploded bodies and i ve had my fucking day ruined i want to believe everything but that this is the direct and necessary result of rescuing the hostages or that is it is fake but i don t know and i can t criticism of today s operation is completely unjustifiable no i m sure they can be criticized somewhere

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-08-22 03:58:30+00:00 --- ---
it was killed and abducted

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2023-10-24 11:10:52+00:00 --- ---
just release all the kidnapped prisoners would seem a reasonable protest and would be a prelude to a ceasefire so why not protest about that

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2023-11-27 09:13:47+00:00 --- ---
they could be releasing the healthy and happiest hostages first for pr probably why some were not surrendered also all these people now have ptsd and witnessed friends family and or neighbors get executed it ll take a while to build up a full picture of how hostages were treated this initial stuff is probably for show

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-04-15 07:30:05+00:00 --- ---
i understand now that lives of hostages doesn t mean anything to you tell me do you care about the hostages

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-06-09 14:15:37+00:00 --- ---
being arrested for trying to stab someone or being otherwise involved in terrorism doesn t make you a hostage

imagine excusing a terror organization for not returning a body in a hostage deal i hope the rest of the terrorist that got freed for her will be hunted down that s the least we can do

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-01-20 11:27:35+00:00 --- ---
they ve forgotten that taking civilian hostages is a war crime

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-08-18 23:20:00+00:00 --- ---
obviously the question is why didn t they limit themselves to only military bases if this was only about resistance and not about causing the maximum number of casualties taking the maximum number of hostages

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-08-30 16:37:38+00:00 --- ---
