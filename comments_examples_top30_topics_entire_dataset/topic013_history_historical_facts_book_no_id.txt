you need to learn some history before you make oversimplified comment like that there s s of years of history and it s not as simple as you make it out to be

you are welcome to draw whatever conclusions you like but for the record in each of the conversations where you decided to stop discussing out of incredulity i would have been happy to point you to the factual historical basis for my understanding if i am mistaken about something i am always happy to be corrected with evidence all the best

once again don t see the relevance to this discussion if you want to grind this axe start another thread and you probably should do it in another sub perhaps one that deals with economic history

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-08-25 06:33:11+00:00 --- ---
you need to remember that history doesn t judge these things on your personal motivation or what you believe it s judged on its outcomes many bad people have believed they were doing the right thing for the right reasons believing in it yourself it doesn t make it right

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-03-30 18:57:19+00:00 --- ---
no i don t think that s an accurate rendition of history i m afraid you are obviously welcome to disagree but i can tell from your comment that you ve never left your intellectual comfort zone and nothing i write is likely to persuade you to start

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2023-12-30 01:06:01+00:00 --- ---
the use of historical facts it s common sense unlike yourself

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-08-13 13:54:44+00:00 --- ---
it does work like that bc no one s writing history anymore we re all going through it in real time due to scial media etc trying to obfuscate a clearcut situation w convoluted examples from the past isn t going to work so stop trying

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2023-11-06 01:58:05+00:00 --- ---
ok so you disagree with history

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-05-30 04:52:07+00:00 --- ---
see the difference between the op and you is that their post is historically accurate and your comment is a fantasy rewrite of history

it s just goofy folks need to pick up a history book heck an hour or so of googling reading up would suffice it isn t that complicated and the historical facts are fairly easy to access this is so true i feel people have become lazy lack curiosity lack interest to seek knowledge even too lazy to read much less do their own research no critical thinking they just wanna be spoon fed with information in small sound bites lack attention span which works well with minutes tiktok reels

think critical for a moment you think history isn t biased history written by man so a history book written by european americans will match books written by native americans same with australia you think governments don t do all sorts of black ops missions and misinform the public false flags never happen and history books don t write the controlled narrative ok gullible naive in my opinion
