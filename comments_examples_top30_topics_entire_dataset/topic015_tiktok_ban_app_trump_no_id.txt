tiktok was my happy place of an endless stream of dance trends viral videos funny animals i have blocked the words palestine and israel and am still getting a barrage of virulent nuttery on there i defended tiktok as harmless but i see how right now it s spreading lies disinformation antisemitism and creating absolute havoc yes people on tiktok love osama bin laden because he had a point you know on tiktok i ve also seen people express regret that the german ww leader who will get the bots attention should have finished the job same with hamas should have finished the job it s a toxic stew over there and if you try to report antisemitism mostly it says no violations found

the fact that people use it at all is terrifying the attention spans of children are at their lowest and the kind of entertainment that can be provided from tik tok ranges from mind numbing at best e g dances to degenerate at worst e g pranks in public i worry what the future is going to look like instead of a generation that grew up reading books we re seeing a society that is so addicted to social media that it s even more normalized than caffeine or porn addiction

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-08-29 21:31:16+00:00 --- ---
people can blame tiktok but the fact is there s an enormous quantity of content showing in unambiguous and unaltered form horrifying war crimes and acts of violence and destruction by israeli soldiers towards palestinian civilians

does palestinians get any benefit from tik tok obviously the main benefits about this app is the share of their hell and how the war is really happening i don t know how the earnings on this app work because i don t know if y can earn just from one viral video or if it is just if u are like an official account with the blue thing and all so i wonder if this people can really directly get help by this apps because we know israel block any kind of help or supplies abroad for palestine do even if tik tok does pay how would they use the money or get the help could someone clarify me this doubt

go back to tiktok reddit is for people who use their brain this comment violates rule as it implies the other user is not intelligent enough for reddit a remark that constitutes a personal attack and undermines respectful discourse in our community
