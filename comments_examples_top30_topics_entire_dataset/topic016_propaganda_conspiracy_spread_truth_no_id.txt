you re insinuating that all sides only rely on conspiracy theories anyway therefore we re somehow all justified in siding with whomever our implicit biases most expediently lead us towards sounds pretty conspiratorial to me

i never belives those normally but they are always one side of the argument to research also in topics it s important to always see things from as many sides as possible and try to think critical of things this is what i did my self when i have researched this topic now and it made me a beliver but i can t think i have ever been on that side before except maybe for some football related stuff if that counts i don t know if you would call it a conspiracy theory though in this case most people with knowledge of the topic say they film propaganda the despute is how much and which is and not also if the normal media is buying those lies or not

i mean no disrespect but you re accusing me of eating propaganda and yet you base your claims on your local news you re at war isn t it reasonable to assume that there s going to be some bias from your side my country is not even at war with anyone and our local news are still completely unreliable when it comes to foreign policies i m sure you got to see the times where airstrikes have been cancelled because of children but children and civilians have been killed these days are you disputing this typo
