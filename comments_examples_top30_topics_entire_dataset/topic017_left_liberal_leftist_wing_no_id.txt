your understanding of leftist understanding is weird but im happy a leftist one time said something how about actually understanding the ideology instead of who you perceive represents it

the areas attacked and many of the victims had disproportionately left wing views based on voting records some were definitely right wing but that misses the point your post is like saying portland oregan was founded as a right wing settler community in the pacific west of north america and therefore to call it left wing is offensive times change also so what if they were right wing in these communities again what is your underlying point

as i see it liberal values are now centrist i may be misusing that word in the american political spectrum yes this has been the case for forever basically as a liberal democracy liberalism had always been pretty centrist the right wing wants to turn illiberal by taking away people s freedom and autonomy the left can be illiberal in their opposition to capitalism which historically has been seen as a liberal system and it was in comparison to feudalism the democratic party shifted rightward after their complete blowout loss in the election particularly after clinton moved the party further to the right into neoliberalism they ve been a center right party for decades but have in recent times become more centrist and maybe even slightly left leaning the democratic party used to espouse liberal values but has shifted towards radical progressives which is as you note often illiberal no lol there s an overreaction to the right wing s rampant unabashed muslim hatred on display for the last two decades where well meaning useful idiots will defend islamists because they see the way muslims are marginalized in american society and think this helps them but that s not nearly as illiberal as the party actively campaigning on stripping away freedoms from people banning books and turning our economy from capitalism back into fuedalism so a lot of liberals have been abandoned by the party that previously stood for their values fundamental misread of american politics the democrats have remained centrist neoliberal for decades while the republican party has goose stepped basically as far right as political thought allows and while pre some republicans still pretended to believe in liberal values they d been using it as an anti democrat insult for decades it s a party fundamentally opposed to liberalism so it makes sense they would try to demonize the word that means someone believes in freedom

usa radical left here i think it s really that we hate the war economy behind both political parties in the usa we sell weapons to both side and provide support to both sides and then are expected to pick favorites when both sides of the conflict is wrong among the left splitting in the usa it s not like we are going to vote republican and we know that democrats are corporate lobbyists too again both sides are wrong

i haven t lived in america in years and am somewhat out of touch with the politics so let me know if this makes sense as i see it liberal values are now centrist i may be misusing that word in the american political spectrum the democratic party used to espouse liberal values but has shifted towards radical progressivism which is as you note often illiberal so a lot of liberals have been abandoned by the party that previously stood for their values but the word liberal is still mistakenly used as a stand in for democrat

there s currently no narrative a leader could tell both the world and his constitutes the conservatives want to reflect our strength both internally and externally while the liberals want to reflect our compassion both are true to some extent but they don t really work together as a message

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2023-05-06 22:29:49+00:00 --- ---
the far left loses credibility as a rationally coherent and practically viable political belief system when it keeps putting shorter and shorter skirts on controversial politically and emotionally charged terms i wouldn t say it undermines the credibility of the belief system but rather devalues the progress it makes towards those beliefs by applying an unjustifiable means i would say that the modern far left is working towards a facist utopia which history has proven just ends up facist i agree with the goals of social justice but i the means to not justify the ends

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-08-14 15:33:58+00:00 --- ---
i ve been on the left since before you were born far left and far right have moved farther apart so now it seems like i m a centrist even though i haven t moved i m okay with it if you want to call me a centrist because it s embarrassing these days to be associated with the pro terrorist pro kidnapper intellectually lazy left in america the right used to be cool and then went crazy a few decades ago now the left is going crazy

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2023-11-09 17:16:29+00:00 --- ---

the problem with the left in general is that they don t believe in accountability for anything they don t believe in accountability for poor choices on health wealth poor career progression hell even in relationships the most common advice is to dump them this is their fault not yours they choose to be victims and blame problems on people who spent years working on themselves to get to where they wanted in life
