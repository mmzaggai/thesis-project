better treatment this war is years old only now you see any positive reaction to what ukraine has been facing even then it takes the best seizure of kyiv for governments yo hi sky send real arms aid not just token packages we saw up until days ago and i say that as someone from a country that lost about half of its territory to the usa not someone excusing some good points you have they are finally because it s impossible to not react with horror to the invasion of a major european capital before this week many were happy parroting russian propaganda and many supposedly supporting still repeat russian media bullshit just like they parrot hasbara bullshit

you are right it was never an official claim made by the u s although the u s and the european intelligence knew it was ukraine even before the attack happened they had been dodging the questions or attributing indirect responsibility to the russia they even launched a fake investigation into the matter it was as real as putin s investigation on prigozhin s death but indeed despite all absurdity there were never an official document being released from the cia or government pinpointing russia on this

in your opinion would it be fair to say that people who leave eastern ukraine do so under duress yes also the council of europe deemed that the forced transfers of children from ukraine to russia constitute an act of genocide

i guess that depends whether the russian government openly says its intention is to depopulate ukraine to fulfil a biblical propechy that it must be owned by one ethnic religious group over another and whether they are bulldozing cities and refugee camps to achieve it

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-09-19 05:09:40+00:00 --- ---
the war is largely being fought in their territory so obviously there are going to be few russian civilians hit if and when ukraine is able to launch a full scale invasion of russia if it gets the go ahead to use western weapons to fire into russia you re going to see a lot more war crimes

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-07-28 17:07:18+00:00 --- ---

our issue is with the representation of the war and the hypocrisy that labels us terrorist while lionizing the same actions of resistance that ukrainians are going through to defend their homes and towns the ukrainians aren t attacking inside russia when the chechyans attacked inside russia the world s attitude changed quite a bit towards them ukraine make no claim to russian territory they do not believe that russia is obligated to remove all russian ethnics from ukraine they recognize the legitimacy of majority russian communities inside ukraine and inside russia

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-01-09 16:05:22+00:00 --- ---

who cares why the russians have a list of grievances against the ukrainians as well any people who committed or wanted to commit genocide had their justifications for it anyone who stands with people who would want nothing more than to committ genocide against the jews in the most horrific and brutal way possible is either delusional or immoral period as long as that s what they want fuck em
