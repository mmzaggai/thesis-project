i understand and agree with going local but we are well past that for companies such as google i m not just referring to their browser they carry a lot of services that are indispensable due to them buying out their competition also going local is a great idea so is creating your own business however our local businesses are getting bought out or forced to close by these larger corporations

unlike mcdonalds and other products google is very hard to boycott it owns youtube i don t see any good alternatives vimeo and dailymotion are very unpopular and many people would find it lame many people made accounts using google so they can t just stop using gmail and people might use it for work purposes and to email other colleagues i don t think the boycott would be very effective unlike the mcdonalds and starbucks boycott

even if you can t get rid of windows there are several open source alternatives to microsoft products it s more than likely that if you look up open source alternatives to the applications you most frequently use you ll be able to replace them with practically no drop in functionality

or protest outside their offices go and give every star service provider and every star provider file the complaints on different google services with complaints on genocide download safari browser and delete chrome give google apps stars on play store and app store flood the reviews with talks for genocide report google ads as offensive boycott using google pay for other apps start by creating an alternate email account and slowly transition from gmail we can mess around with a lot of user generated data on google maps we can make it inconvenient for businesses to be on google

can you use the kindle app on your computer tablet phone rather than cloud reader on a browser i suspect some of that might have to do with drm and needing to be signed into your own google account digital purchase it might also have to do with the method used to convert the book to electronic format scanned materials lack page numbers hyperlinks etc

we don t have to boycott google completely to give them a bit of a limp we can start with ad revenue and browser search engine switching access youtube through duckduckgo don t use chrome we also need to spread the word i think that we will be able to male a measurable impact on google s bottom line at the moment they re acting with total impunity we need to show them and the tech world at large that collectively we can deliver a serious payload it should send a powerful message to the smaller companies
