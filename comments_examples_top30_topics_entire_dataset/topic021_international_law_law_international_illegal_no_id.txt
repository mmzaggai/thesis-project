read it and compare it to the icty and ictr rulings if it s consistent with those prior rulings in methodology and findings accept it however if they argue for a different methodology the prosecution will be forced to justify why such a methodology was not used in prior cases and why such was done here that s where the stumbling block is ultimately going to be for a prosecution of such consistency with those two rulings if international law is to have any value it must be consistent in application

i disagree with your exaggerated facts for now those are all just declarations we saw so so many times leaders declare something and do something else sometimes opposite plus its only people who are willing to leave so why not give them a fair chance this will not really change anything as a lot will choose to stay and that s totally fine it wont change much and in my opinion thats just part of negotiations and putting pressure on the other side

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2023-10-16 14:32:43+00:00 --- ---
it s propaganda posturing refuse all formal negotiations in private settings and then project your own bad faith negotiating onto the other party in a public setting in an attempt to gain leverage

well one could argue because there hasn t been an election in many years arguably since before half the population was born but under international law they are a legitimately recognized government so it comes down to if you want to take the international law side or some other side does this make sense

i wrote those posts they aren t about usa lack of buy in to the concept of international law if you read them the usa then and now supports international law they don t agree with the european theory of implementation in some details the objections are primarily about the prosecutorial and trial process the constitution affords americans protections that don t exist in european systems that the icc would strip them of had the europeans been willing to offer usa style trials the objections the americans raised in the s wouldn t have turned into full blown rejectionism the attempt to extort americans into denying the constitution is a european diplomatic error not some failure to believe in international law thanks for the referral

i m unclear what point you are making are you saying that international law doesn t exist because there s not a corresponding enforcement arm enforcement occurs through diplomatic pressure and domestic laws at the member state level zero countries would agree to give up enforcement to an international governing body international law doesn t exist just like most things that are social constructs like borders and land rights but beyond that metaphysical discussion international law is very much a real thing
