almost like starving a population isn t that good of an idea

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-08-07 21:33:29+00:00 --- ---
the conclusion isn t that hunger isn t real it s that it is overstated as it has been for the last months

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-08-01 13:27:26+00:00 --- ---
all the comments in here are wild it s almost like starving kids isn t a popular idea

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-08-23 11:14:35+00:00 --- ---

people are dying of starvation i m sure cringey era bacon jokes will help

actually it does prove a point you should probably not believe so hard that it s all famine when it s clearly not that s just information bias why not just say some parts are hit hard but most is not so wrong of you to do otherwise

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-08-23 14:22:59+00:00 --- ---
their assessments were made using sound methodology and often were followed by changes that mitigated the risk that doesnt mean that the projections were false especially considering that when their reccomendations were unneeded we ended up with the current situation where more and more people are dying of starvation

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-08-04 08:26:53+00:00 --- ---
kids and the elderly starve quicker for metabolic reasons look it up

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-08-02 21:52:06+00:00 --- ---
it s not because of decency it s because starvation is a lie and need to stop

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-02-08 15:56:44+00:00 --- ---
where s the evidence then all he was asking for is evidence so if you believe it provide evidence if the starvation is as bad as it s made out to be worst food crisis in existence then people will have died of starvation in alarming numbers should be easy to provide proof

--- subreddit: Palestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-07-29 07:40:34+00:00 --- ---
what do you call a manufactured famine if there is enough food and other necessary resources to go around but a country decides to wall off an area with m people in it and refuses to let anything inside or out thats not a famine that makes it sound like a natural desaster something outside of himan control i would call that attempted mass murder in m cases in addition to that you have prominent politicians of this government calling the idea to letting food through into the area morally bankrupt i have no words to describe this twisted morality

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-08-03 12:33:03+00:00 --- ---
can we shift our focus back on the people dying now and not why it doesn t look like a real famine to you how many have died from starvation given that it s been years of famine and millions have been in danger yeah so tell me again how many died from starvation

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-05-28 17:48:24+00:00 --- ---
that s what i thought too also did you know that americans die each year from malnutrition

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-08-15 04:41:54+00:00 --- ---
ok let s let reporters in then why not right there s no starvation happening so why not let independent journalists in to verify that

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-08-06 20:43:26+00:00 --- ---
hahahhaha really please look up the calories in kg of any dry good staple i literally cannot believe that you have fallen for this math

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-08-21 05:12:38+00:00 --- ---
people were claiming starvation when kfc is open in icon mall tell me about it

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-08-08 08:42:14+00:00 --- ---
it is you can deny it but even if there is truth to the claims of hunger which there obviously is i dont doubt this this just throws doubt on the whole thing also during covid the image were indeed countless and the media used legit photos with legit narratives here that is not the case or at least not always the nyt is a major player they should do this right

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-03-11 14:20:53+00:00 --- ---
not only is the article you cite well after the polling it s not even reporting about existing starvation it s reporting about the possibility of future starvation you do not have the facts here to support your claim

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-08-23 16:06:57+00:00 --- ---
kcal is not enought you need at least like range and by their own numbers they are distributed like meals a day not million

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-08-01 05:12:03+00:00 --- ---
starvation deaths seems very high considering how long we need to go without food before we starve out of a m population no it isn t high

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-07-27 13:27:12+00:00 --- ---
we get it you get off killing and starving babies

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-06-15 15:21:06+00:00 --- ---
yes and they need to break it to bring the food do i miss something or am uninformed

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-07-30 18:57:23+00:00 --- ---
if you look at them and think starvation you need better knowledge what years of starvation does to a man

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-07-31 15:36:16+00:00 --- ---
just search nyt starvation and look at the many pictures used not just one this particular photo was just very striking

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-07-30 14:11:30+00:00 --- ---
how come we don t see pictures of dozens of walking skeleton adults children starve faster than adults they have significantly higher metabolisms and smaller energy stores

--- subreddit: Palestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-05-26 02:55:14+00:00 --- ---
they are taunting people starving to death

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-07-30 16:16:04+00:00 --- ---
adults take a lot longer to starve like much much longer they have far more in reserve you know this of course but you need to deflect from the atrocities you support

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-08-19 12:33:57+00:00 --- ---
children with genetic conditions don t die of starvation unless they can t access food this seems like a pretty logical conclusion but apparently it needs to be spelled out for you the alleged staged holding bowls of food photo was already thoroughly debunked and was not staged they were at a legitimate food kitchen waiting to be fed in fact someone on this subreddit made a post with links to videos behind the scenes of the documentary that was being filmed of the photographer

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-07-31 22:17:18+00:00 --- ---
these were malnutrition related diseases deaths not hunger deaths you have no idea what you re talking about

--- subreddit: Palestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-05-03 16:47:00+00:00 --- ---
except starvation has been happening all year and now it s speeding up

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-05-21 11:33:04+00:00 --- ---
you re trying to split hairs between dying and suffering from malnutrition but this is a false distinction used to obscure the reality on the ground malnutrition is not some abstract condition it s a slow brutal death sentence especially for children it irreparably damages bodies and minds weakens immune systems and leads to preventable deaths that pile up day after day look at history the effects of malnutrition are comparable to some of the most notorious war crimes like the use of agent orange in vietnam which caused generational suffering birth defects and premature death starvation and malnutrition are weapons of war in themselves inflicting horrific long term suffering not just immediate fatalities so when tens of thousands of children are declared malnourished and denied essential food medicine and clean water under siege it s not some legal gray zone it is a systematic state sanctioned form of collective punishment and a violation of international law

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-07-29 21:12:01+00:00 --- ---
the wikipedia article is worth reading euromed is garbage propaganda the famine thing is nuanced there s no evidence that there s widespread famine but the situation in still really bad the lancet article is just a possible estimate that figure should not be taken as fact

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-08-18 14:42:33+00:00 --- ---
thats the weirdest snarky comment after you couldn t even get basic facts right while endorsing starving a population

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-08-02 21:51:23+00:00 --- ---
starvation doesn t mean everyone being a living skeleton nor does it mean there is no food or water at all just extremely limited to sustain everyone s life metabolism differs from one person to another general health differs from person to person that s why you see healthy children and adults they re not they re starving but they re bodies didn t react as quickly

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-05-10 11:13:03+00:00 --- ---
square miles bombed to shreds you think starving people are good to walk square miles for a meal

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-07-31 05:13:49+00:00 --- ---
take the recent starvation pr campaign the nyt cover of the starving boy which neglected to mention his well fed brother

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-07-31 15:24:18+00:00 --- ---
i dont think that boy looks healthy either he looks like he hasn t washed in weeks criticising the nyt for lying about a starving child doesn t mean we jump to all the children must therefore be healthy

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-07-31 13:58:17+00:00 --- ---
great so not only are we are starving healthy peopl we re starving people with pre existing issues disabilities thats somehow even worse also wasnt his pre existing health issue developed because his mother was not getting enough nutrients while he was in her uterus because she s being starved

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-05-08 15:08:11+00:00 --- ---
to wish for the starvation of tens of thousands of people is beyond reprehensible look at what you ve become shame on you

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-01-11 23:15:49+00:00 --- ---
what is the definition of starving

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-07-30 13:40:17+00:00 --- ---
so after months of starvation there be no outward sign also these weren t warnings they were statements of fact just like all those babies that were going to die in hours maybe you should just stop replying if you have nothing constructive to add

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-08-07 20:32:31+00:00 --- ---
well you and me don t always see eye to eye but this article is indeed interesting seems like the issue is mainly the definition of staged and the fact the times and other newspapers used only the photo with the empty pots and sad women therefore implying a total absence of food which is not the complete story but if they showed full pots of food how could they claim starvation as they want to

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-07-31 08:41:58+00:00 --- ---
the mother and the brother of the kid the brother was cropped out look completely healthy though bad look for the nyt and if you need to prove famine in this way you might not have a good case at all
