the same argument could be made for catholics and our holy wars and more modern violent conflicts like the troubles in ireland in the late s conflict often seems to become more prevalent when a government affiliates officially or preferentially with one religion

pope francis pushed for equality and urging the catholic church on lgbtq acceptance as he was one of the most progressive popes so it doesn t disqualify him as pope for being homophobic

everyone knows the vatican has long been a bastion of muslim extremism the whole spreading catholicism all over the world since before the inception of islam is just a front peter was secretly a follower of mohammed that s why he and paul had that power struggle after jesus was all upon this rock i shall build my church and peter became the first pope the petrine tradition is actually secret islam that s what s documented in the secret archives we should definitely share this crucial information with zionists s in case it s not obvious

from the very start mind you since the first nakba anyone who says the pope is late to this like here is either willfully ignorant or unknowingly lapping up protestant zionist propaganda some links and quotes for anyone interested the church s stance on palestine what has been said about the right to homeland also applies to the palestinian people so many of whom remain homeless and refugees pope st john paul ii article on history of vatican support of palestine and vatican israeli relations even if we are well aware of the tragedies not so long ago which have compelled the jewish people to seek a secure and protected garrison in a sovereign and independent state of their own and because we are aware of this we would like to invite the children of this people to recognize the rights and legitimate aspirations of another people which have also suffered for a long time the people of palestine pope st paul vi christmas message article on vatican s position on present conflict israel s right of self defense which has been invoked to justify this operation must be proportional and with thirty thousand dead it certainly isn t cardinal parolin current secretary of state back when there were only thirty thousand dead pope s comments on gaza one of many times he s commented i call gaza daily there s a parish there and within its school are people christians and muslims living as brothers and sisters they tell me horrible stories difficult things please when you see the bodies of killed children when you see that under the presumption that some guerrillas are there a school is bombed this is ugly it is ugly it s sometimes said that this is a defensive war but sometimes i believe that it s a war too much too much i apologize for saying this but i don t see steps being taken toward peace brief explanation on catholicism s view of just war edit fun with christian zionism second text is the latin patriarch of jerusalem friends rejecting christian zionism first text is the protestants response good summary this one goes into theology quite a bit

take my anecdotal experience with a grain of salt but my experience with american catholics has been surprising i don t doubt the fuentes fans are just simply antisemitic but regular catholics i have seen have been overwhelmingly pro palestinian both online and in my community and surrounding communities of both rural and urban middle america catholics catholics are traditionally very humanitarian in their motivations and there s only so much information propaganda can hide from you before the floodgates open also most people really really like the pope despite what some loud fringe conservatives want you to believe

i do respect your position and it is true that the holy see did accumulate wealth in the millennia via tributes and non moral ways such as wars and persecutions however i still do not think that it is a reason to disregard the good deeds that they push now a bulletproof vehicle sent to gaza as a mobile health unit is a good thing regardless of who it comes from the same can be said for most of the charities connected to caritas nobody here wants to forget the inquisition or the cathar crusade we should however appreciate that pope francis was an ally of the palestinian cause which is especially useful when you are an influential figure that leads one of the worlds biggest religions the catholic church is not a supporter of israel let s not forget that and cross fingers that it does not change with the next pope

on a mission of generations there are generations of jews that dreamt of coming here and generations of jews who will come after us so if you re asking if i have a sense of mission historically and spiritually the answer is yes he appears to be using the term in a national sense the entity here is the jewish people not a supernational divinity this only makes it worse for me as a german because we know that nothing good will follow as soon as a head of state believes he is on a historical and spiritual mission that s really a propaganda term written by later opponents reformers it didn t actually happen in a literal sense i think it is very bold to describe a period of popes as non existent saeculum obscurum as a result a third of the popes during this period were removed from office another third ended up in prison in exile or were murdered however the popes not only failed to live up to the moral demands of their office through their involvement in serious crimes they also aroused public interest through their dissolute lifestyles this sometimes led to the era being referred to as the rule of women and whores or the age of pornocracy translated from the german wikipedia article celibacy the prohibition on bishops marrying predates the th century by a lot not does it have anything to do with mistresses you might mean celibacy which is a vow bishops don t take even today since the th century directly after the period of pornocracy celibacy has been required of priests and bishops in the roman catholic church the pope is also the bishop of rome

christians have the vatican is not true just catholics have the vatican protestant christians have no concept of a home base for our different religions within protestant christianity so its a weird concept for us i noticed a lot of non christians think we christians have a holy place like the jews and muslims do but no we dont lol and even with the vatican its location isnt special or anything it just happened to be there over time no one makes pilgrimages like jewish and muslim people do its a big religious office for the catholics as far as most protestants are concerned lol i think this makes it weird for a lot of protestant christians to try to understand this stuff we have no concept of a home base so we cant empathize with losing something like that if you lose it just make a new one obviously i wouldnt suggest that but like idk what else to do lol if we lost the vatican the art and texts inside would be more devastating than the actual building no one would care about the religious symbolism of the building if no one was hurt and no art scripture lost we can just make a new one doesnt even need to be in the same spot we also have a history of disagreeing on which christian capitol is the real one lol we had different popes at once now we just dont care now catholics might not agree with me on that though lol but they also dont make any pilgrimage to the vatican unless they are wealthy enough to travel in the first place no one does it to specifically fulfil religious things as opposed to muslims and jews who from what i understand many of their religious sects require a pilgrimage to various holy sites idk how strict they are about this though i have jewish friends that make a point to visit isreal every year for religious reasons not sure how required it is

american catholics are an odd breed because of the political environment in the us they side with evangelical christians and take very untraditional stances for catholics
