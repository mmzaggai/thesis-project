the most exciting recent research on corvids imho is that the populations who live in cities are getting smarter and the changes are generally proportional to the size and density is the city eg the corvids in tokyo and nyc are getting smarter faster than the ones in omaha and fresno and all of them are moving much faster than rural corvids who may not even be going that direction at all what s really exciting about that fact is that corvid intelligence is a bit different than some of the other smart birds like parrots there are basically two practical physical pathways for a species to get smarter over time in response to selective pressure the first is to fold the brain in a more complex way and to tweak optimize the grey matter density to allow for maximum iq this evolutionary pathway takes a lot of time but it s how parrots with their relatively small heads got so smart the other way is to just get a bigger brain this sometimes involves making the head bigger relative to the size of the body like humans did but it more often involves making the entire animal bigger like whales did obviously these are not all mutually exclusive eg humans evolved over the last few million years to be physically larger than our most recent primate ancestors with proportionally larger skulls brains with grey matter density super optimized and with extremely dense brain folding but the only one of these evolutionary pathways that is realistic for a species to naturally access over the course of only a few dozen or even a hundred generations as opposed to generations or and that s is the larger body size skull pathway the really really exciting thing about corvids accessing that pathway also imho is that the main constraint on getting bigger and bigger are about food access predation gestation giving birth laying eggs and metabolism all of those issues are ones corvids can handle increasing large amounts as opposed to for example elephants who can t get more than bigger or humans who can t fit bigger heads through our birth canals it means it s even possible that we could eventually have corvids that are too big to fly but still otherwise functional with skulls and brains x or x larger
